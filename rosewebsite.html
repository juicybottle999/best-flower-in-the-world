 pink, red, orange, yellow, and white. They may be from 0.5 inch (1.3 centimeters) to 7 inches 
(18 centimeters) across. Wild roses usually have five petals. Roses grown by people often have 
many sets of petals. The petals grow out from a fleshy, fruitlike structure known as a hip.</p>

<p>Roses are native to China but are now grown across the world and thrive in sunny,
 well-drained soil. They particularly like clay soils and it is best to grow roses away from
 other plants so their roots are not disturbed. It is important to remember that hybridized
 flowers such as roses have become more adaptable to different conditions so check 
when buying your roses what the optimum conditions are.</p>

 the world. It is characterised by wide range of colours and sizes.Care Tips :
Roses need to be fed regularly and the amount of feeding will depend on the kind of soil they
 are planted in. Pruning is also important and should be done after between mid-February
